- Mendelssohn
- Some kind of acronym
- "Composer"

Name versions after famed composers?

Should be different names. One for printer, one for software.

Probably nothing to do with printing; those names are way overused.

Take examples from 2D printers. Inkjet, Bubblejet, Stylus, Officejet, Envy,
Photosmart, Pixma, Selphy, Maxify, Workforce, Primera, Oki
