Specification for Hardware
--------------------------

Goal: Everything should be off-the-shelf for easy purchase / assembly.
Misumi's great; it has all kinds of T-slot, linear slides, etc.

Frame (kind of expensive; perhaps I shouldn't overengineer as much?):
- Misumi 40mm 2-slot black anodized T-slot (HFSB5-4040)
- Matching black anodized brackets, heavy duty (HBLUDB5)
- Nuts, Bolts
- End caps
- Leveling feet
- Acrylic side plates

Projector:
- DLP something. I'll try to get one used, but cheap off-the-shelf would be better.

Z-Stage:
- Pre-built linear stage
- NEMA 17 or 23

(no wiper; will experiment with printing sections of a layer at a time)

Electronics:
- Raspberry Pi B+
- Arduino (mini?) for stepper driver real-time control
- Stepper driver (Geckodrive?)
- LCD + buttons for front controller

Miscellaneous:
- USB extension cables
- Power bus (just a power strip?)
