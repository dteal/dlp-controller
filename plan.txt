Implementation Plan
-------------------

1) Prototyping:
- Get some random DLP projector
- Buy resin
- Build Z-axis with surplus stepper motors + drivers (may be BS2-controlled)
- Prove ideas
- Use Creation Workshop

2) Testing:
- Control projector from Pi
- Slice STL
- QT on Pi
- Control stepper from Pi
- Connect to Pi over network/USB/internet

3) Design:
- CAD enclosure
- Order parts

4) Assembly:
- Should be quick. All COTS parts.

5) Finishing:
- Test everything once more
- Finalize software
- Print!
