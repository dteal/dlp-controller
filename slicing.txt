Software Algorithms
-------------------

Goal: Given an input file (initially only .STL), output
a high-resolution bitmap of a single layer perpendicular to the Z axis.

Should support antialiasing (optional), additional filters
Should assume very large meshes; many, many triangles.

Hopefully it can run on a Raspberry Pi.



Naively:

(1) Find all triangles that intersect the given plane
(2) Find line of intersection with triangles
(3) Use raster parity-based filling to create an image
